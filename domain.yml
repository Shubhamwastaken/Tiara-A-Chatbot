  utter_animals:
  - text: "At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role\
      \ in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information\
      \ available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered\
      \ to be low. A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the\
      \ virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.\n\
      Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine\
      \ and feline coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and\
      \ are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.\nHowever, since animals\
      \ can spread other diseases to people, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy\
      \ habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining\
      \ good hygiene."
  utter_what_animals:
  - text: "We don’t know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus that\
      \ causes COVID-19. WHO is aware of a small number of pets, including dogs and\
      \ cats, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly\
      \ after close contact with people with COVID-19. A tiger at a zoo in New York\
      \ has also tested positive for the virus.\nRecent research shows that ferrets,\
      \ cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus\
      \ and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory\
      \ settings. Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the\
      \ infection based on results from these studies. Data from one study suggested\
      \ dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets.\
      \ These findings were based on a small number of animals, and do not show whether\
      \ animals can spread infection to people.\nAt this time, there is no evidence\
      \ that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.\
      \ Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading\
      \ COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. Further studies are needed to\
      \ understand if and how different animals could be affected by the virus that\
      \ causes COVID-19 and the role animals may play in the spread of COVID-19."
  utter_medicines_therapies:
  - text: While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and
      alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can
      prevent or cure the disease. We does not recommend self-medication with any
      medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However,
      there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional
      medicines. We will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical
      findings are available.
  utter_antibiotics:
  - text: No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial
      infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics
      should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should
      only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection.
  utter_likely_to_catch:
  - text: The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there
      is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. For most people in most locations the
      risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around
      the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living
      in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments
      and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19
      is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement
      or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your
      risk of catching or spreading COVID-19. COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained
      and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries.
      Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware
      of the situation where you are or intend to go.
  utter_feces:
  - text: The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears
      to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in
      feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the
      outbreak. The ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue
      to share new findings. Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason
      to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating.
  utter_no_symptoms:
  - text: The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled
      by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with
      no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience
      only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease.
      It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example,
      just a mild cough and does not feel ill.A mathematical model from a 2020 study
      supports this, suggesting that 40–80% of transmission stems from those showing
      no symptoms.
  utter_spread_through_air:
  - text: Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted
      through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.
  utter_anything_i_shouldn't_do:
  - text: "The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be\
      \ harmful :- \n1. Smoking \n2. Wearing multiple masks 3. Taking antibiotics\
      \ without prescription. In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty\
      \ breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more\
      \ severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your\
      \ health care provider."
  utter_package:
  - text: Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods
      is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package
      that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature
      is also low.
  utter_surface:
  - text: The most important thing to know about coronavirus on surfaces is that they
      can easily be cleaned with common household disinfectants that will kill the
      virus. But it is still not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives
      on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other corona viruses. Studies suggest
      that corona viruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus)
      may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary
      under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of
      the environment). If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple
      disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands
      with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching
      your eyes, mouth, or nose.
  utter_incubation_period:
  - text: The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning
      to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for
      COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates
      will be updated as more data become available.
  utter_dispose_mask:
  - text: "1. Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers,\
      \ and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.\n2. Before\
      \ touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and\
      \ water. \n3. Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.\n4. Orient which\
      \ side is the top side (where the metal strip is).\n5. Ensure the proper side\
      \ of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).\n6. Place the mask to your\
      \ face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the\
      \ shape of your nose. \n7. Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth\
      \ and your chin.\n 8. After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops\
      \ from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes,\
      \ to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask.\n 9. Discard\
      \ the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.\n 10. Perform hand hygiene\
      \ after touching or discarding the mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if\
      \ visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap and water."
  utter_mask:
  - text: "Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing)\
      \ or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only\
      \ be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then\
      \ you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so We urge\
      \ people to use masks wisely. We advises rational use of medical masks to avoid\
      \ unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks The most effective\
      \ ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean\
      \ your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain\
      \ a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing.\
      \ 4 Types of masks available and is recommended are :- \n 1. Surgical Mask \n\
      \ 2. N95 and FFP1 masks \n 3.Activated Carbon Masks \n 4.Cloth or sponge masks"
  utter_sars:
  - text: No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak
      of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other
      genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different. SARS was more
      deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks
      of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.
  utter_vaccine:
  - text: Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine
      to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care
      to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most
      patients recover thanks to supportive care. Possible vaccines and some specific
      drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical
      trials. The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19
      are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow
      or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people
      who are coughing or sneezing
  utter_protection:
  - text: "Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available\
      \ on the national,state and local public health authority. Many countries around\
      \ the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities\
      \ in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their\
      \ outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for\
      \ the latest news. You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading\
      \ COVID- 19 by taking some simple precautions :-\n1. Regularly and thoroughly\
      \ clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and\
      \ water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based\
      \ hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.\n2. Maintain at least 1\
      \ metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.\
      \ Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from\
      \ their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can\
      \ breathe in the droplets, including\the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing\
      \ has the disease.\n3. Avoid touching yes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch\
      \ many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer\
      \ the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your\
      \ body and can make you sick.\n4. Make sure you, and the people around you,\
      \ follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with\
      \ your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used\
      \ tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory\
      \ hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and\
      \ COVID-19. \n5. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and\
      \ difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the\
      \ directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities\
      \ will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling\
      \ in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the\
      \ right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread\
      \ of viruses and other infections.\n6. Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19\
      \ hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible,\
      \ avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have\
      \ diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching\
      \ COVID-19 in one of these areas."
  utter_symptoms:
  - text: The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough.
      Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat
      or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people
      become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people
      (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around
      1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops
      difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems
      like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop
      serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek
      medical attention.
  utter_protective_measure_14days:
  - text: "1. Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with\
      \ mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight\
      \ runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone\
      \ bring you supplies or to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid\
      \ infecting other people. Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical\
      \ facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help\
      \ protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.\n2. If you\
      \ develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly\
      \ as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition.\
      \ Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with\
      \ travelers. Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to\
      \ quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent\
      \ possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses."
  utter_safe_to_travel:
  - text: "The government has asked people to avoid public transport if at all possible\
      \ to help general public maintain distance with limited capacity, and keep the\
      \ public transport for those who need it most. If you need to travel by Indian\
      \ National Rail or public buses please try to travel Off-Peak, keep a 2-metre\
      \ distance from others, use a face covering, and carry hand sanitiser or wash\
      \ your hands.\nIn turn, Indian Railway and Public Bus Transport companies will\
      \ do everything possible to keep passengers safe, including :-\n1. More frequent\
      \ and thorough cleaning than normal on trains, buses and at stations or stops.\
      \ \n2. Giving clear safety guidance on journeys, and \n3. Make extra train and\
      \ bus carriages available whenever possible.\nIf your journey is necessary and\
      \ you need to travel by Indian National Rail, please remember that railway stations\
      \ may be busy and leave plenty of time for your journey."
  utter_corona_for_life:
  - text: Most of the people who catch COVID-19 can recover and eliminate the virus
      from their bodies. If you catch the disease, make sure you treat your symptoms.
      If you have cough, fever, and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early
      - but call your health facility by telephone first. Most patients recover thanks
      to supportive care.
  utter_5g:
  - text: Viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. COVID-19 is spreading
      in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks. COVID-19 is spread through
      respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. People
      can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then their eyes,
      mouth or nose.
  utter_houseflies:
  - text: To date, there is no evidence or information to suggest that the COVID-19
      virus transmitted through houseflies. The virus that cause COVID-19 spreads
      primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes
      or speaks. You can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and
      then touching your eyes, nose or mouth before washing your hands. To protect
      yourself, keep at least 1-metre distance from others and disinfect frequently-touched
      surfaces. Clean your hands thoroughly and often and avoid touching your eyes,
      mouth and nose.
  utter_hydroxychloroquine:
  - text: While several drug trials are ongoing, there is currently no proof that
      hydroxychloroquine or any other drug can cure or prevent COVID-19. The misuse
      of hydroxychloroquine can cause serious side effects and illness and even lead
      to death. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop and evaluate medicines to treat
      COVID-19.
  utter_Thermal_scanner:
  - text: Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have a fever (i.e.
      have a higher than normal body temperature). They cannot detect people who are
      infected with COVID-19. There are many causes of fever. Call your healthcare
      provider if you need assistance or seek immediate medical care if you have fever
      and live in an area with malaria or dengue.
  utter_gloves:
  - text: WHO(World Health Organization) recommends wearing gloves when you are cleaning
      or caring for someone who is sick. In most other situations, like running errands,
      wearing gloves is not necessary, instead practice washing your hands with soap
      and water for 20 seconds (or using a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol)
      Disposable gloves are highly recommended while taking care of sick or if you
      using for the protection of yourself. Wearing gloves outside of these instances
      (for example, when using a shopping cart or using an ATM) will not necessarily
      protect you from getting COVID-19 and may still lead to the spread of germs.
  utter_ppe:
  - text: "Personal Protective Equipments (PPEs) are protective gears designed to\
      \ safeguard the health of workers by minimizing the exposure to a biological\
      \ agent. Components of PPE are goggles, face-shield (Google and face shield\
      \ work similar), mask, gloves, coverall/gowns (with or without aprons) head\
      \ cover and shoe cover.\n The price of PPE kit start from Rs. 200 and depends\
      \ on the component you want to add or remove."
  utter_face_shield:
  - text: "It is proven and is advised by many health experts that face shield is\
      \ better than mask. It is reusable by disinfecting it every time or washed.\
      \ It is comfortable to breathe in and prevent wearer to touch their face. It\
      \ reinforce the importance of physical distancing. But to get complete protection,\
      \ it should extend to below the chin. It should also cover the ears there should\
      \ be no exposed gap between the forehead and the shield's headpiece. \nPrice\
      \ of face shield start from Rs.70. \nGoogles also work similar as face shield,\
      \ but can only cover eyes and some extent to ears. Masks are worn alongwith\
      \ Goggles."
  utter_diff_mask:
  - text: "There are 4 major types of mask available and you should wear mask according\
      \ to places you go. \n 1. SURGICAL MASK: commonly available form of masks in\
      \ the market, surgical masks protect a person against large splashes of droplets,\
      \ water, sprays and used in medical facilities. While they do cover your mouth,\
      \ surgical masks can't really protect you from catching or transmitting the\
      \ coronavirus or any such microbe in the air, since it has loose gaps which\
      \ can help the germs crawl in. A high-grade surgical mask can stop the transmission\
      \ of different kinds of viruses (up to 80-90%), especially if used by a person\
      \ who is sick. If the wearer coughs or sneezes, the surgical mask will help\
      \ collect the larger particles expelled. The price of surgical mask is between\
      \ Rs.1 to Rs. 20. \n2. N95 and FFP1: Masks with N95 rating filter 95% of particles\
      \ 0.3 microns or larger in diameter, roughly the size of a single virus and\
      \ include PM 2.5. Some masks also have an attachment called the exhalation valve,\
      \ which can filter out humidity build-up and is best for those having suffocation\
      \ problem. Compared to all other masks, N95 masks offer the highest level of\
      \ protection Price of N95 mask start from Rs.150 and KN95 mask Rs. 60 (similar\
      \ to N95 with little different in leak of exhalation valve. N95 is better than\
      \ KN 95. Both mask come with and without exhalation valve.) \n FFP1 masks are\
      \ considered an alternative to respiratory masks, such as the N95 ones. FFP1\
      \ masks protect a person from breathing in particles of more hazardous quality.\
      \ Price of FFP1 mask start from Rs. 30. \n3. ACTIVATED CARBON MASKS: these masks\
      \ contain an activated carbon filter, which help collect and filter out the\
      \ pollutants and germs and breathe in purer air. these masks work very well\
      \ in fighting pollution and tiny particles like bacteria and fungi which spread\
      \ through the air we breathe in, and thereby, prevent allergies. However, they\
      \ do not work exceptionally well in fighting or preventing viruses like COVID-19\
      \ from coming in contact. They can only trap a minuscule number of viruses (10-20%)\
      \ and hence, may not be the best choice right now. The price starts from Rs.40.\
      \ \n 4. CLOTH MASKS: Homemade masks offer LESSER protection than surgical or\
      \ respirator masks. However, as the WHO guidelines read, they can help a person\
      \ keep the face area clean and prevent the spread of nasty germs and other contagious\
      \ viruses. Sanitization and disinfecting are crucial steps which can prevent\
      \ and stop the spread of coronavirus. Cloth and sponge masks filter out about\
      \ 50% of bacteria and dust pollutants."

  - text: Maharashtra is the most affected State of India with over 1 Lakh cases.
  utter_plasma_therapy:
  - text: "Plasma therapy involves using blood plasma from people who have recovered\
      \ from COVID-19 and infusing it into patients who currently have the disease.\
      \ Plasma is the liquid portion of blood that remains when all red and white\
      \ blood cells and platelets have been removed. It was over a hundred years ago\
      \ that Emil Behring was awarded the first Nobel prize for physiology and medicine\
      \ for his work demonstrating that plasma could be used to treat diphtheria.\
      \ \nWe now know that the key component of plasma for treating infections is\
      \ antibodies. Antibodies are Y-shaped proteins that are highly specific for\
      \ whichever infection a person has previously encountered. They are produced\
      \ in vast quantities by B cells of our immune system in order to bind to the\
      \ invading virus and then target it for destruction. The concept of vaccination\
      \ relies on stimulating antibody production to infections not yet met. In contrast,\
      \ using convalescent plasma involves the transfer of antibodies from donors\
      \ who have already mounted an immune response, thus offering immediate (but\
      \ transient) protection to the recipient. \nWorldwide there are over 60 clinical\
      \ trials actively recruiting COVID-19 patients to study the effect of convalescent\
      \ plasma. Patients are typically given about 500ml plasma intravenously, and\
      \ their progress is then carefully monitored. Many studies are using plasma\
      \ from non-infected patients as the placebo arm of the trial, to ensure that\
      \ any benefits identified are indeed specific for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies."
  utter_dangerous_coronavirus:
  - text: "Covid-19 is transmitted much more readily between humans than its closest\
      \ relation, Sars, which caused outbreaks of serious disease in a few countries\
      \ in 2003. The new coronavirus is, however, less dangerous to most people it\
      \ infects than Sars. Computer modelling suggests that each new Covid-19 case\
      \ infects 2.5 other people on average when no effort is made to keep people\
      \ apart. The Chinese authorities have greatly reduced this “reproduction number”\
      \ through drastic action to isolate cases and trace their contacts — and the\
      \ rest of the world is rapidly introducing social distancing measures. \nThe\
      \ virus has caused severe respiratory disease in about 20 per cent of patients\
      \ and killed more than 3 per cent of confirmed cases. Sars killed 10 per cent\
      \ of infected individuals. Older people, whose immune defences have declined\
      \ with age, as well as those with underlying health conditions, are much more\
      \ vulnerable than the young. \nBut fatality rates are hard to estimate in the\
      \ early stages of an epidemic and depend on the medical care given to patients.\
      \ For example, ventilators save lives by enabling people with pneumonia to breathe.\
      \ Most experts believe the current fatality rate is exaggerated by serious under-diagnosis\
      \ of mild cases; the best current estimate is that Covid-19 will kill around\
      \ 1 per cent of those infected in a population with good healthcare. \nFor comparison,\
      \ seasonal flu has a mortality rate below 0.1 per cent but it infects so many\
      \ people that it results in about 400,000 deaths a year worldwide. Spanish flu\
      \ infected an estimated 500m people and killed 50m worldwide in 1918-19. Hypothetically,\
      \ if Covid-19 affected half the world’s current population over the course of\
      \ a year with a 1 per cent fatality rate, the death toll would be 35m — substantially\
      \ increasing the number of deaths worldwide, which is around 60m for all causes\
      \ in a typical year."
  utter_coronavirus_family:
  - text: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause illness
      ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory
      Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
  utter_community_transmission:
  - text: "According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), community transmission\
      \ “is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of\
      \ transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests\
      \ through sentinel samples (routine systematic testing of respiratory samples\
      \ from established laboratories)”. \nIn other words, community transmission\
      \ or spread is said to be taking place when the source of the contagion is not\
      \ known, i.e. when one is unable to trace an infection back to a carrier who\
      \ has travelled in an affected area, or through contact with a person who has\
      \ the disease. \nA state of community spread implies that the virus is now circulating\
      \ in the community, and can infect people with no history — either of travel\
      \ to or contact with affected people and areas. At this stage, it is theoretically\
      \ possible for everyone to catch the infection."

  utter_coronavirus_229E:
  - text: CoV229e is one of several coronaviruses that cause common colds. Biologically
      related to SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), but different viruses.
  utter_vomiting_and_diarrhea:
  - text: Nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea occur fairly frequently early in the infection,
      but are rarely if ever the only symptoms. If cough and fever don't develop within
      a day or two after vomiting or diarrhea, probably it isn't COVID-19.
  utter_criteria_for_test:
  - text: Real vs. textbook. Real-life criteria is different because we don't have
      enough tests, supplies, or medical staff around the world at this time (June
      2020). Textbook criteria are suspected COVID in hospitalized persons or in those
      with underlying medical conditions; or persons who got symptoms less than 14
      days after (1) contact with a suspect or confirmed COVID patient or (2) travel
      through high-risk COVID area.
  utter_corona_intro:
  - text: Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals
      and birds. In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that
      can be mild, such as some cases of the common cold (among other possible causes,
      predominantly rhinoviruses), and others that can be lethal, such as SARS, MERS,
      and COVID-19
  utter_corona_food_spread:
  - text: Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through
      respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission
      of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important
      to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food
      safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing
      or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
  utter_high_risk:
  - text: Older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions
      may be at higher risk for more serious complications from COVID-19. These people
      who may be at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness, includes;
      Older adults, People who have serious underlying medical conditions like...
      Heart disease, Diabetes, Lung disease.

  utter_warm_weather:
  - text: It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of
      COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during
      cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with
      these viruses during other months.  At this time, it is not known whether the
      spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer.  There is much
      more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated
      with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
  utter_corona_spread:
  - text: People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can
      spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which
      are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land
      on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19
      by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
      People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with
      COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to
      stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.
